#### Predict Weekly Store Sales Forecasting using dataset from Kaggle Competitions by Walmart.

### Abstract
Prediction of sales is one of the most important factors to any organization. 
Through the prediction of sales the organizations can actually plan for the demand throughout the year. 
These predicted sales not only help the operations of the organization go smoother but also boosts the morale of the workers. 
In this paper we have predicted the weekly sales by training eight different regression models and chose the best one by measuring their performance using (RMSE, MAE, MSE R^2,) 
The chosen dataset is an historic dataset of an organization which has the data present in 4 separate files.
